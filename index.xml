The discussion has been evolving, I am starting to see early signs of polarization, and a mix of denial and overly enthusiastic adoption. Ethical considerations, which had been largely ignored for a good while, are finally getting an increasingly relevant role if not in the decision making, at least in the reflections from many academics. And experimentation is picking up, starting to provide some clarity on the ups and downs of the current revolution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI in Education - Some food for thought</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/ai-in-education-some-food-for-thought/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 08:38:51 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/ai-in-education-some-food-for-thought/</guid><description>&lt;p>What are we supposed to do about GenAI in (mathematical) education?
Many of us have been wrestling with it over the past few months. I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t have a definitive answer, but it&amp;rsquo;s a topic that demands we share what we&amp;rsquo;re thinking and what we&amp;rsquo;re seeing. If anything, it may bring a felt and needed opportunity to finally be able to rethink and reshape the way our education is organized. We discussed this in less uncertain times both in &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/not-just-numbers/episodes/S1E03---Teaching-mathematics--with-Tams-Grbe-and-Ceclia-Salgado-e2bsae3">It&amp;rsquo;s Not Just Numbers&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S2-Ep9---Specifications-Grading-e2oida7">various&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S3E01-Critical-Pedagogy-and-the-Work-of-Paulo-Freire-e2oid9u">episodes&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S3E06---Ungrading-e2oidaq">Degrees of Freedom&lt;/a>, our podcasts on mathematics and education respectively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Riemann rearrangement theorem in the browser</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/riemann-rearrangement-theorem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Dec 2024 14:59:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/riemann-rearrangement-theorem/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the first exercises when studying convergence of infinite series asks to show that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$ is divergent while $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}$ is convergent. In more technical terms, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}$ is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditionally_convergent">&lt;strong>conditionally convergent&lt;/strong> series&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is in contrast to &lt;strong>absolutely convergent&lt;/strong> series, that is, infinite sums $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ such that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n|$ is also convergent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is peculiar about conditionally convergent series, is that it is possible to rearrange the terms in the sequence so that the sum of the rearrangement converges to any arbitrary number. This is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_series_theorem">&lt;strong>Riemann&amp;rsquo;s rearrangement theorem&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running LLMs Locally With Ollama</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/running-llms-locally-with-ollama/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 11:14:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/running-llms-locally-with-ollama/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://www.mseri.me/running-llms-locally/">my previous post&lt;/a>, I explored various ways to run Large Language Models locally.
Since that post, I have been pointed to try another powerful tool for this purpose: &lt;a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama&lt;/a>.
This open-source project makes it incredibly easy to run LLMs on your local machine, offering a great balance between simplicity and flexibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it does not seem as flexible as the &lt;code>llm&lt;/code> python library I presented in the other post and it can scare some users with its command-line interface, I was impressed by its ease of use and the wide range of models it supports.
I am not overselling this, its simplicity is staggering: you can get started with just a few commands.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running LLMs locally</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/running-llms-locally/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 18:37:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/running-llms-locally/</guid><description>&lt;p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for generating human-like text responses. You might be familiar with them through services like &lt;a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://claude.ai/">Anthropic Claude&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity AI&lt;/a>,
Nowadays people are using them for editing purposes, writing, brainstorming, and even for generating code snippets.
When used &lt;strong>responsibly and critically&lt;/strong> as a tool to assist human creativity, they can be very helpful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, I spent some time playing with these models and I found them fascinating. However, due to privacy concerns and their high environmental costs, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable using cloud-based services.
This post is an account of my experience with running LLMs locally on my machines.
This can be quite straightforward, and if you have 8-16GB of RAM and a decent GPU, you can run these models on your own computer without significant issues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A brief introduction to git, with an eye towards mathematicians</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/a-brief-intro-to-git/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 14:56:34 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/a-brief-intro-to-git/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a followup to my &lt;a href="https://www.mseri.me/git-workflow-for-lazy-mathematicians/">previous post on git from 11 years ago&lt;/a>.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using git for a while now and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a few things since then, that I think are worth sharing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not going to explain in detail what git is, how to install it and how it works; there are plenty of resources for that.
It will be enough for our purposes to know that &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com">&lt;code>git&lt;/code>&lt;/a> is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes in your files and collaborate with others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Giving Good Maths Talks</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/giving-good-maths-talks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 10:59:27 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/giving-good-maths-talks/</guid><description>&lt;p>The upcoming block I have to coordinate a course on giving good talks.
This also meant looking for good extra material for the students to reflect on what it means to give a good talk, what to be aware of and what tips can help to do a good job.
Here is a collection of the resources I liked so far:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>MAA has a &lt;a href="https://mathcomm.org/teaching-presentations/handouts-other-presentation-resources-for-students/">curated list of resources on giving mathematics talks&lt;/a> which includes plenty of &lt;a href="https://mathcomm.org/teaching-presentations/examples-of-good-math-presentations/">examples of good mathematics presentations&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is an essay by John McCarthy on &lt;a href="http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/workshops/gcoll.pdf">how to give a good colloquium talk&lt;/a> with a response blog post on &lt;a href="https://blog.richmond.edu/wross/2008/03/26/how-to-give-a-good-20-minute-math-talk/">how to give a good 20min talk&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the blog of the AMS there is a nice post on &lt;a href="https://blogs.ams.org/mathmentoringnetwork/2014/08/04/math-talk-preparing-your-conference-presentation/">preparing a conference presentation&lt;/a>, from what it means to many resources on how it can be done&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What characterizes a good presentation? There is a nice summary from an &lt;a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-821-project-laboratory-in-mathematics-spring-2013/resources/mit18_821s13_presentnotes/">analogous course at MIT&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Terence Tao has a famous blog post on &lt;a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/talks-are-not-the-same-as-papers/">giving talks&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jordan Ellenberg has a post with &lt;a href="https://quomodocumque.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/what-to-do-in-talks/">tips on giving talks&lt;/a> that links an &lt;a href="https://quomodocumque.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/talktipsheet.pdf">interesting pdf on the same topic&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A nice &lt;a href="https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/~kra/papers/talks.pdf">essay on giving talks&lt;/a> by Bryna Kra&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Let me know on twitter or mastodon (links on the left bar) if you have other suggestions!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Panel discussion on the Future of Higher Education</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/panel-discussion-on-the-future-of-higher-education/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 13:28:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/panel-discussion-on-the-future-of-higher-education/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I was invited to participate to a panel discussion as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.rug.nl/fse/education/the-future-of-higher-education-launch-symposium-of-the-centre-for-learning-and-teaching#panel">symposium on the future of higher education&lt;/a> hosted by our faculty for the launch of the Centre for Learning and Teaching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I joined other four incredible panelists and we have been given in advance five quite broad (and though) questions on some important aspects of (high) education. I want report here my contribution, with some extra commentary at the end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>So You Are Moving to Mastodon</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/so-you-are-moving-to-mastodon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 09:52:41 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/so-you-are-moving-to-mastodon/</guid><description>&lt;p>After Elon Musk announced its interest in acquiring twitter and even more now that he did it, there has been a growing influx of people to &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon&lt;/a>, a &lt;a href="https://axbom.com/fediverse/">decentralized&lt;/a> social media platform inspired by twitter but in some sense further influenced by forums and emails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few tools and suggestions that have been shared around recently, and I thought of blogging them here to save them.
The culture on Mastodon is quite different and more thoughtful than the one in Twitter.
It takes a bit of getting used to it and what to do or avoid.
Overall it makes it a much more pleasant experience (in my opinion).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Man Who Saved Geometry</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/the-man-who-saved-geometry/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 17:32:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/the-man-who-saved-geometry/</guid><description>&lt;p>The other day I found an old file with links to interesting videos.
Some of them were no longer available, some I still have to check, but &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/120725835">one caught my attention&lt;/a> and the other evening I decided to watch it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a little documentary on the last conference of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Scott_MacDonald_Coxeter">Donald Coexeter&lt;/a>, and I enjoed watching it very much. You can find it embedded below, and linked above. And while collecting links for this post I have also discovered &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220102093914/https://www.math.toronto.edu/mpugh/Coxeter.pdf">a nice writeup&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

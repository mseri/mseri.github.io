<span class=posts-list-item-description><span><blockquote><p>There is a different way forward. Artificial intelligence doesn’t have to be what it is today. We don’t need to accept the logic of unprecedented scale and consumption to achieve advancement and progress. So much of what our society actually needs—better health care and education, clean air and clean water, a faster transition away from fossil fuels—can be assisted and advanced with, and sometimes even necessitates, significantly smaller AI models and a diversity of other approaches. AI alone won’t be enough, either: We’ll also need more social cohesion and global cooperation, some of the very things being challenged by the existing vision of AI development.
But the empires of AI won&rsquo;t give up their power easily. The rest of us will need to wrest back control of this technology&rsquo;s future. And we&rsquo;re at a pivotal moment when that&rsquo;s still possi-ble. Just as empires of old eventually fell to more inclusive forms of governance, we, too, can shape the future of AI together.

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span><p>I think an update on my previous blog post on <a href=/ai-in-education-some-food-for-thought/>generative AI in education</a> is in order. The discussion has been evolving, I am starting to see early signs of polarization, and a mix of denial and overly enthusiastic adoption. Ethical considerations, which had been largely ignored for a good while, are finally getting an increasingly relevant role if not in the decision making, at least in the reflections from many academics. And experimentation is picking up, starting to provide some clarity on the ups and downs of the current revolution.</p></span><br><span><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg> 7 min read -

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span><p>What are we supposed to do about Generative AI in (mathematical) education?</p><p>Many of us have been wrestling with it over the past few months. I certainly don&rsquo;t have a definitive answer, but it&rsquo;s a topic that demands we share what we&rsquo;re thinking and what we&rsquo;re seeing. If anything, it may bring a felt and needed opportunity to finally be able to rethink and reshape the way our education is organized. We discussed this in less uncertain times both in <a href=https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/not-just-numbers/episodes/S1E03---Teaching-mathematics--with-Tams-Grbe-and-Ceclia-Salgado-e2bsae3>It&rsquo;s Not Just Numbers</a> and <a href=https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S2-Ep9---Specifications-Grading-e2oida7>various</a> <a href=https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S3E01-Critical-Pedagogy-and-the-Work-of-Paulo-Freire-e2oid9u>episodes</a> of <a href=https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S3E06---Ungrading-e2oidaq>Degrees of Freedom</a>, our podcasts on mathematics and education respectively.</p></span><br><span><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg> 7 min read -

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span><p>One of the first exercises when studying convergence of infinite series asks to show that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$ is divergent while $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}$ is convergent. In more technical terms, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}$ is a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditionally_convergent><strong>conditionally convergent</strong> series</a>.</p><p>This is in contrast to <strong>absolutely convergent</strong> series, that is, infinite sums $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ such that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n|$ is also convergent.</p><p>What is peculiar about conditionally convergent series, is that it is possible to rearrange the terms in the sequence so that the sum of the rearrangement converges to any arbitrary number. This is called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_series_theorem><strong>Riemann&rsquo;s rearrangement theorem</strong></a>.</p></span><br><span><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg> 2 min read -

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span><p>In <a href=https://www.mseri.me/running-llms-locally/>my previous post</a>, I explored various ways to run Large Language Models locally.
Since that post, I have been pointed to try another powerful tool for this purpose: <a href=https://ollama.com/>Ollama</a>.
This open-source project makes it incredibly easy to run LLMs on your local machine, offering a great balance between simplicity and flexibility.</p><p>While it does not seem as flexible as the <code>llm</code> python library I presented in the other post and it can scare some users with its command-line interface, I was impressed by its ease of use and the wide range of models it supports.
I am not overselling this, its simplicity is staggering: you can get started with just a few commands.</p></span><br><span><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg> 4 min read -

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for generating human-like text responses. You might be familiar with them through services like <a href=https://chat.openai.com/>ChatGPT</a>, <a href=https://claude.ai/>Anthropic Claude</a>, <a href=https://gemini.google.com/>Google Gemini</a>, and <a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/>Perplexity AI</a>,
Nowadays people are using them for editing purposes, writing, brainstorming, and even for generating code snippets.
When used <strong>responsibly and critically</strong> as a tool to assist human creativity, they can be very helpful.</p><p>Recently, I spent some time playing with these models and I found them fascinating. However, due to privacy concerns and their high environmental costs, I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable using cloud-based services.
This post is an account of my experience with running LLMs locally on my machines.
This can be quite straightforward, and if you have 8-16GB of RAM and a decent GPU, you can run these models on your own computer without significant issues.</p></span><br><span><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg> 7 min read -

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span><p>After Elon Musk announced its interest in acquiring twitter and even more now that he did it, there has been a growing influx of people to <a href=https://joinmastodon.org/>Mastodon</a>, a <a href=https://axbom.com/fediverse/>decentralized</a> social media platform inspired by twitter but in some sense further influenced by forums and emails.</p><p>There are a few tools and suggestions that have been shared around recently, and I thought of blogging them here to save them.
The culture on Mastodon is quite different and more thoughtful than the one in Twitter.
It takes a bit of getting used to it and what to do or avoid.
Overall it makes it a much more pleasant experience (in my opinion).</p></span><br><span><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg> 2 min read -

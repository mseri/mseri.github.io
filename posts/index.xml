The idea was to show how to implement the basic typeclasses of Category Theory in OCaml, and how to use them to build a simple parser combinator library, by following what I had learned from Haskell.
At the time, not knowing better, I stumbled upon an annoying issue: if you look at the code examples for the &lt;code>Alternative_Utils&lt;/code> module, you will find the following commented-out code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Circular Time</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/circular-time/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 10:15:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/circular-time/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>’Forty-two,’ said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The narrative on AI keeps swinging between panicked existential threats and overoptimistic hype. Last week, while flu forcefully made sure I sayed in bed, I had time to read some articles in my backlog and really found it disappointing how the discussion has stagnated and keeps revolving around the same points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None of the ideas look anywhere new. In &lt;em>The Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/em>, Douglas Adams already brilliantly satirized on the quest for superintelligence and what will happen with it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lowering the barrier to feedback</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/lowering-the-barrier-to-feedback/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 14:22:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/lowering-the-barrier-to-feedback/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.jakeworth.com/posts/whats-wrong-with-this-idea/">What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with this idea?&lt;/a>
I was reading the linked blog post this morning, and it got me thinking about honest feedback.
A suggestion that I usually share with our students is to send their draft to those friends that are not afraid to give honest criticism, and ask them to be brutally honest on what they think about any part of the draft, clarifying that it will not be taken personally.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bringing the data back: from the US to us</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/bringing-the-data-back-from-the-us-to-us/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 10:12:23 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/bringing-the-data-back-from-the-us-to-us/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while, but especially over the past few months, I have been trying to be increasingly more conscious of the digital tools I use. It is so convenient to rely on the usual US‑based suspects for email, storage, and collaboration, that we may forget that we are their product and that they may take all of our staff away from us in a whim, with no chances to appeal or get it back before we are locked out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journey in Progress: my experience with meditation</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/journey-in-progress-my-experience-with-meditation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 18:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/journey-in-progress-my-experience-with-meditation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Have you ever felt like you are constantly running behind, never quite in control? If so, you are not alone. For a long time, I felt this way too, and sometimes I still do. But over the past couple of years, I have experienced a shift in my mindset and overall well-being. I hope that sharing this journey might resonate with others who have felt the same way. Reading about others&amp;rsquo; struggles and small victories has always helped me, so I hope this might do the same for someone else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Four months in the University Council</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/four-months-in-the-university-council/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 09:10:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/four-months-in-the-university-council/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This is a repost of my original blog post from the Science Faction blog: &lt;a href="https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/organization/administrative-organization/participation-decision-making/uraad/science-faction/blog/the-uc-experience-four-months-later">The UC experience, four months later&lt;/a>. Since university blog posts get archived after a while, I&amp;rsquo;m keeping this copy here for reference.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been four months since I joined the university council, and I am still quite glad I had this opportunity. So far, it has been a continuous learning process. Not just about the university and the forces shaping it from the inside and out, but also, and maybe more importantly, about how to run large meetings with an open mind and an atmosphere that fosters lively yet respectful discussions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Our first month in the University Council</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/our-first-month-in-the-university-council/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 12:00:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/our-first-month-in-the-university-council/</guid><description>&lt;p>A month has passed since the new &lt;a href="https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/organization/administrative-organization/participation-decision-making/uraad/?lang=en">University Council (UC)&lt;/a> was installed, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to look back on what has happened so far, and what seems to lie ahead. When I enlisted I promised myself to help improve the transparency of the discussions and keep an open channel with anybody that could be interested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This first month has been a whirlwind of activity, training, and initial discussions. Much of our work so far has focused on preparation: only now I start to see how crucial is to build a good foundation of knowledge and trust for the decisions and actions to come.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Different Way Forward</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/a-different-way-forward/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2025 12:27:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/a-different-way-forward/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There is a different way forward. Artificial intelligence doesn’t have to be what it is today. We don’t need to accept the logic of unprecedented scale and consumption to achieve advancement and progress. So much of what our society actually needs—better health care and education, clean air and clean water, a faster transition away from fossil fuels—can be assisted and advanced with, and sometimes even necessitates, significantly smaller AI models and a diversity of other approaches. AI alone won’t be enough, either: We’ll also need more social cohesion and global cooperation, some of the very things being challenged by the existing vision of AI development.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>UnAI Education?</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/unai-education/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 17:27:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/unai-education/</guid><description>&lt;p>I think an update on my previous blog post on &lt;a href="https://www.mseri.me/ai-in-education-some-food-for-thought/">generative AI in education&lt;/a> is in order. The discussion has been evolving, I am starting to see early signs of polarization, and a mix of denial and overly enthusiastic adoption. Ethical considerations, which had been largely ignored for a good while, are finally getting an increasingly relevant role if not in the decision making, at least in the reflections from many academics. And experimentation is picking up, starting to provide some clarity on the ups and downs of the current revolution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI in Education - Some food for thought</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/ai-in-education-some-food-for-thought/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 08:38:51 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/ai-in-education-some-food-for-thought/</guid><description>&lt;p>What are we supposed to do about Generative AI in (mathematical) education?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of us have been wrestling with it over the past few months. I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t have a definitive answer, but it&amp;rsquo;s a topic that demands we share what we&amp;rsquo;re thinking and what we&amp;rsquo;re seeing. If anything, it may bring a felt and needed opportunity to finally be able to rethink and reshape the way our education is organized. We discussed this in less uncertain times both in &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/not-just-numbers/episodes/S1E03---Teaching-mathematics--with-Tams-Grbe-and-Ceclia-Salgado-e2bsae3">It&amp;rsquo;s Not Just Numbers&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S2-Ep9---Specifications-Grading-e2oida7">various&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S3E01-Critical-Pedagogy-and-the-Work-of-Paulo-Freire-e2oid9u">episodes&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S3E06---Ungrading-e2oidaq">Degrees of Freedom&lt;/a>, our podcasts on mathematics and education respectively.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span><h1 id=introduction><a class=hanchor href=#introduction>#</a>&nbsp;Introduction</h1><p>Category theory is an abstrac mathematical framework that had a huge influence
on pure functional programming design patterns. The abstractions and laws that
come bundled with the mathematical concepts allow us to write safer and
composable interfaces, very prone to equational reasoning, at the price of a
steeper learning curve. If you attempt to write some relatively modern Haskell
code, you will inevitably have to deal with Monoids, Functions, Monads, Lenses
and whatnot <a href=https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia title=Typeclassopedia>typeclassopedia</a>. Also, if you are using modern OCaml libraries,
you will find fingerprints of these constructs all over the place, even though
there they are less prominent.</p></span><br><span><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg> 34 min read -

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span><p><em>A former student, who was also once a student of Tomonaga’s, wrote to extend his congratulations. Feynman responded, asking Mr. Mano what he was now doing. The response: &ldquo;studying the Coherence theory with some applications to the propagation of electromagnetic waves through turbulent atmosphere&mldr; a humble and down-to-earth type of problem.&rdquo;</em></p><p>Dear Koichi,</p><p>I was very happy to hear from you, and that you have such a position in the
Research Laboratories. Unfortunately your letter made me unhappy for you seem
to be truly sad. It seems that the influence of your teacher has been to give
you a false idea of what are worthwhile problems. The worthwhile problems are
the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute
something to. A problem is grand in science if it lies before us unsolved and
we see some way for us to make some headway into it. I would advise you to take
even simpler, or as you say, humbler, problems until you find some you can
really solve easily, no matter how trivial. You will get the pleasure of
success, and of helping your fellow man, even if it is only to answer a
question in the mind of a colleague less able than you. You must not take away
from yourself these pleasures because you have some erroneous idea of what is
worthwhile.</p></span><br><span><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg> 4 min read -

Swift is unbelievably flexible from this point of view: one can easily define new generic <code>infix</code>, <code>prefix</code> or <code>suffix</code> operator, and state their associativity and precedence properties.

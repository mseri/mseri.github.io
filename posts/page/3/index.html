<span class=posts-list-item-description><span><p><em>A former student, who was also once a student of Tomonaga’s, wrote to extend his congratulations. Feynman responded, asking Mr. Mano what he was now doing. The response: &ldquo;studying the Coherence theory with some applications to the propagation of electromagnetic waves through turbulent atmosphere&mldr; a humble and down-to-earth type of problem.&rdquo;</em></p><p>Dear Koichi,</p><p>I was very happy to hear from you, and that you have such a position in the
Research Laboratories. Unfortunately your letter made me unhappy for you seem
to be truly sad. It seems that the influence of your teacher has been to give
you a false idea of what are worthwhile problems. The worthwhile problems are
the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute
something to. A problem is grand in science if it lies before us unsolved and
we see some way for us to make some headway into it. I would advise you to take
even simpler, or as you say, humbler, problems until you find some you can
really solve easily, no matter how trivial. You will get the pleasure of
success, and of helping your fellow man, even if it is only to answer a
question in the mind of a colleague less able than you. You must not take away
from yourself these pleasures because you have some erroneous idea of what is
worthwhile.</p></span><br><span><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg> 4 min read -

<span class=posts-list-item-description><span><p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been playing with Apple&rsquo;s newborn Swift quite a lot. I have to say that I am really impressed, and except for few things that I hope will be smoothed in the next months (years?), I find Swift really enjoyable and readable.</p><p>However, there is one feature that I really miss. Something that I daily use with slightly different syntaxes in Sh, Haskell, Julia and Elixir: the <strong>pipe</strong>!</p><h3 id=can-we-implement-a-_kind-of_-pipe-in-swift><a class=hanchor href=#can-we-implement-a-_kind-of_-pipe-in-swift>#</a>&nbsp;Can we implement a <em>kind of</em> pipe in Swift?</h3><p>Given that in Swift <code>|</code>, <code>.</code> and <code>||</code> have already quite precise and distinct meanings, I am going to mimic Julia and Elixir&rsquo;s notation and use <code>|></code>.
Swift is unbelievably flexible from this point of view: one can easily define new generic <code>infix</code>, <code>prefix</code> or <code>suffix</code> operator, and state their associativity and precedence properties. You&rsquo;ll soon see that the syntax speaks by itself!</p></span><br><span><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon icon-clock"><title>clock</title><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"/></svg> 4 min read -

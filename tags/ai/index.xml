&lt;p>There is a different way forward. Artificial intelligence doesn’t have to be what it is today. We don’t need to accept the logic of unprecedented scale and consumption to achieve advancement and progress. So much of what our society actually needs—better health care and education, clean air and clean water, a faster transition away from fossil fuels—can be assisted and advanced with, and sometimes even necessitates, significantly smaller AI models and a diversity of other approaches. AI alone won’t be enough, either: We’ll also need more social cohesion and global cooperation, some of the very things being challenged by the existing vision of AI development.
But the empires of AI won&amp;rsquo;t give up their power easily. The rest of us will need to wrest back control of this technology&amp;rsquo;s future. And we&amp;rsquo;re at a pivotal moment when that&amp;rsquo;s still possi-ble. Just as empires of old eventually fell to more inclusive forms of governance, we, too, can shape the future of AI together.

The discussion has been evolving, I am starting to see early signs of polarization, and a mix of denial and overly enthusiastic adoption. Ethical considerations, which had been largely ignored for a good while, are finally getting an increasingly relevant role if not in the decision making, at least in the reflections from many academics. And experimentation is picking up, starting to provide some clarity on the ups and downs of the current revolution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI in Education - Some food for thought</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/ai-in-education-some-food-for-thought/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 08:38:51 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/ai-in-education-some-food-for-thought/</guid><description>&lt;p>What are we supposed to do about Generative AI in (mathematical) education?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of us have been wrestling with it over the past few months. I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t have a definitive answer, but it&amp;rsquo;s a topic that demands we share what we&amp;rsquo;re thinking and what we&amp;rsquo;re seeing. If anything, it may bring a felt and needed opportunity to finally be able to rethink and reshape the way our education is organized. We discussed this in less uncertain times both in &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/not-just-numbers/episodes/S1E03---Teaching-mathematics--with-Tams-Grbe-and-Ceclia-Salgado-e2bsae3">It&amp;rsquo;s Not Just Numbers&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S2-Ep9---Specifications-Grading-e2oida7">various&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S3E01-Critical-Pedagogy-and-the-Work-of-Paulo-Freire-e2oid9u">episodes&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S3E06---Ungrading-e2oidaq">Degrees of Freedom&lt;/a>, our podcasts on mathematics and education respectively.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

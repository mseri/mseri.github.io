Many of us have been wrestling with it over the past few months. I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t have a definitive answer, but it&amp;rsquo;s a topic that demands we share what we&amp;rsquo;re thinking and what we&amp;rsquo;re seeing. If anything, it may bring a felt and needed opportunity to finally be able to rethink and reshape the way our education is organized. We discussed this in less uncertain times both in &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/not-just-numbers/episodes/S1E03---Teaching-mathematics--with-Tams-Grbe-and-Ceclia-Salgado-e2bsae3">It&amp;rsquo;s Not Just Numbers&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S2-Ep9---Specifications-Grading-e2oida7">various&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S3E01-Critical-Pedagogy-and-the-Work-of-Paulo-Freire-e2oid9u">episodes&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/degrees-of-freedom/episodes/S3E06---Ungrading-e2oidaq">Degrees of Freedom&lt;/a>, our podcasts on mathematics and education respectively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Giving Good Maths Talks</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/giving-good-maths-talks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 10:59:27 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/giving-good-maths-talks/</guid><description>&lt;p>The upcoming block I have to coordinate a course on giving good talks.
This also meant looking for good extra material for the students to reflect on what it means to give a good talk, what to be aware of and what tips can help to do a good job.
Here is a collection of the resources I liked so far:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>MAA has a &lt;a href="https://mathcomm.org/teaching-presentations/handouts-other-presentation-resources-for-students/">curated list of resources on giving mathematics talks&lt;/a> which includes plenty of &lt;a href="https://mathcomm.org/teaching-presentations/examples-of-good-math-presentations/">examples of good mathematics presentations&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is an essay by John McCarthy on &lt;a href="http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/workshops/gcoll.pdf">how to give a good colloquium talk&lt;/a> with a response blog post on &lt;a href="https://blog.richmond.edu/wross/2008/03/26/how-to-give-a-good-20-minute-math-talk/">how to give a good 20min talk&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the blog of the AMS there is a nice post on &lt;a href="https://blogs.ams.org/mathmentoringnetwork/2014/08/04/math-talk-preparing-your-conference-presentation/">preparing a conference presentation&lt;/a>, from what it means to many resources on how it can be done&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What characterizes a good presentation? There is a nice summary from an &lt;a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-821-project-laboratory-in-mathematics-spring-2013/resources/mit18_821s13_presentnotes/">analogous course at MIT&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Terence Tao has a famous blog post on &lt;a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/talks-are-not-the-same-as-papers/">giving talks&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jordan Ellenberg has a post with &lt;a href="https://quomodocumque.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/what-to-do-in-talks/">tips on giving talks&lt;/a> that links an &lt;a href="https://quomodocumque.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/talktipsheet.pdf">interesting pdf on the same topic&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A nice &lt;a href="https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/~kra/papers/talks.pdf">essay on giving talks&lt;/a> by Bryna Kra&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Let me know on twitter or mastodon (links on the left bar) if you have other suggestions!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Panel discussion on the Future of Higher Education</title><link>https://www.mseri.me/panel-discussion-on-the-future-of-higher-education/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 13:28:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mseri.me/panel-discussion-on-the-future-of-higher-education/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I was invited to participate to a panel discussion as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.rug.nl/fse/education/the-future-of-higher-education-launch-symposium-of-the-centre-for-learning-and-teaching#panel">symposium on the future of higher education&lt;/a> hosted by our faculty for the launch of the Centre for Learning and Teaching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I joined other four incredible panelists and we have been given in advance five quite broad (and though) questions on some important aspects of (high) education. I want report here my contribution, with some extra commentary at the end.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

If so, you are not alone. For a long time, I felt this way too, and sometimes I still do. But over the past couple of years, I have experienced a shift in my mindset and overall well-being. I hope that sharing this journey might resonate with others who have felt the same way. Reading about others&amp;rsquo; struggles and small victories has always helped me, so I hope this might do the same for someone else.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

on pure functional programming design patterns. The abstractions and laws that
come bundled with the mathematical concepts allow us to write safer and
composable interfaces, very prone to equational reasoning, at the price of a
steeper learning curve. If you attempt to write some relatively modern Haskell
code, you will inevitably have to deal with Monoids, Functions, Monads, Lenses
and whatnot &lt;a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia" title="Typeclassopedia">typeclassopedia&lt;/a>. Also, if you are using modern OCaml libraries,
you will find fingerprints of these constructs all over the place, even though
there they are less prominent.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
